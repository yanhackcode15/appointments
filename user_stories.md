### **MVP (2-day build)**
The goal of the MVP is to demonstrate the core functionalities needed to manage appointments effectively.

#### **Functionalities:**
1. **User Registration/Login:** Secure authentication for users (both staff and clients).
2. **Appointment Scheduling:** Clients can book appointments, choosing from available time slots.
3. **Basic Dashboard:** For salon team to view and manage their bookings.

#### **User Stories:**
1. As a client, I want to book appointments using my phone number so that I can quickly schedule a visit without the need for registering an account.
2. As a client, after entering my phone number, I want to be able to either select an existing family member or add a new one, choose from a list of available dates and times, optionally select a stylist, and pick a service from the menu to finalize creating an appointment. Each appointment must include the client's name, selected service(s), date, and time, and if no stylist is selected, one should be assigned at random.
3. As a business owner, I want to view all scheduled appointments for any given day to manage staff assignments and prepare for the day's clients.
4. As a business owner or manager, I want to access detailed profiles for each client that include their transaction history, any notes made by stylists, and copies of their invoices, so I can better understand and serve our clients.

### **Phase 2**
1. Security and Privacy: Given that clients are identified by phone numbers and can potentially access sensitive information (transaction history, family members), consider including a user story about securing personal information and verifying identities.
2. Notifications: Clients and business owners might benefit from notifications about upcoming appointments or changes to the schedule. Consider adding user stories for notification features.
3. Cancellation and Rescheduling: It might be beneficial to include user stories that address how clients can modify or cancel appointments, as well as how these changes are communicated to the business.
4. Feedback and Ratings: After service completion, capturing feedback or ratings from clients could be valuable. Consider adding a user story for clients to provide feedback on their service experience.

#### **Functionalities:**
1. **Calendar Integration:** Sync appointments with external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar).
2. **Appointment Modifications:** Allow clients to reschedule or cancel appointments.
3. **Notifications:** Email and SMS reminders for upcoming appointments.
4. **Staff Management:** Enable profiles for different staff members, showing their schedules to clients.

#### **User Stories:**
1. As a client, I want to sync my appointments with my personal calendar to keep track of my schedule.
2. As a client, I want to modify my appointments, giving me flexibility in managing my time.
3. As a business owner, I want to send automated reminders to reduce no-shows.
4. As a staff member, I want clients to see my available times so they can book appointments with me directly.

### **Phase 3**
Implement advanced features that support scaling and provide detailed insights.

#### **Functionalities:**
1. **Advanced Reporting:** Analytics on appointment trends, staff performance, and client retention.
2. **Multi-location Support:** Manage appointments across multiple business locations.
3. **Customizable Booking Page:** Allow businesses to customize the look and feel of their booking pages.
4. **API Access:** Enable integration with other tools and systems via an API.

#### **User Stories:**
1. As a business owner, I want detailed reports on how my business is performing to make informed decisions.
2. As a business owner, I want to manage multiple locations through a single platform to simplify operations.
3. As a business owner, I want to customize my booking page to align with my brand identity.
4. As a developer, I want to access the system via an API to integrate with other systems and extend functionality.





I aim to adopt an iterative development approach, building out the appointment app in manageable, incremental stages. This method allows for continuous integration and testing of features day-by-day, aligning with the learning curve for new technologies like NestJS. Each day's work results in a functional, albeit feature-limited, version of the app, enabling myself to progressively expand functionality while ensuring robustness and usability from the start. Hereâ€™s a reworded and structured version of your ask:

I am looking to develop a hair salon appointment app using an iterative development approach. Given my learning goals with NestJS and other libraries, I aim to structure the development process into daily increments, where each day concludes with a working, testable version of the application, albeit with a limited set of features. This approach will allow me to:

1. Assess and Refine: Regularly test and refine each functionality as it's developed, ensuring each segment meets quality standards before moving on.
2. Manage Complexity: Break down the development into smaller, manageable tasks, which helps in handling the learning curve without being overwhelmed by the complexity of the entire system.
3. Stay Adaptable: Make adjustments to the project scope and design based on daily feedback and testing results.


Development Milestones
1. Day 1: Setup the basic project structure with NestJS and implement a simple version where clients can use a phone number to create an appointment for a specific date and time.
2. Day 2: Add functionality for clients to select or add a family member when booking an appointment.
3. Day 3: Introduce the ability to choose a service and optionally select a stylist; implement random stylist assignment if not chosen.
4. Day 4: Develop the business owner's view to see appointments scheduled for the day.
5. Day 5: Add features for viewing client transaction history and taking notes.

6. Subsequent Days: Incrementally introduce more complex features such as appointment modifications, cancellations, client notifications, security enhancements, and user feedback systems.
This structured, daily progression ensures that the app remains functional at every stage, and allows for consistent progress tracking and immediate usability testing, aligning with both developmental and educational objectives.

This rewording outlines your project management strategy, emphasizing an iterative, educational approach to software development that prioritizes gradual complexity management and continuous learning.
